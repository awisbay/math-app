# Phase 7 Authoring Guidelines (Indonesian Math)

## Writing Principles
- Use clear Indonesian suitable for target grade.
- Use short sentence structure for lower grades.
- Avoid ambiguous wording and multiple interpretations.
- Ensure only one objectively correct answer.

## Question Composition
- Stem:
  - Context relevant to student age.
  - Avoid unnecessary long narratives.
- Choices:
  - 4 options recommended (A-D).
  - Distractors plausible and pedagogically useful.
  - Keep choice length balanced.
- Explanation:
  - Explain reasoning in simple Indonesian.
  - Include step-by-step for complex items.

## Grade Alignment Rules
- Grade 1-3: basic arithmetic, concrete context, minimal abstraction.
- Grade 4-6: mixed operations, fractions/measurement foundations.
- Grade 7-9: algebraic reasoning and geometric problem solving.
- Grade 10-12: higher abstraction, functions/statistics/calculus basics.

## Difficulty Calibration
- Level 1: direct recall/basic operation.
- Level 2: simple application.
- Level 3: multi-step but straightforward.
- Level 4: deeper reasoning.
- Level 5: advanced challenge (limited use).

## Quality Anti-Patterns (Avoid)
- Tricky wording with hidden assumptions.
- Two or more potentially correct options.
- Options with obvious length/pattern clue.
- Language that requires advanced reading beyond grade level.
